readme for phase 3

need to talk about all 3 iterations, separated into their respective folders

format them?
- question is if all 7 steps will be shown, anad how to do that
- include pdf of each iteration as well
- make the readme the same as the pdf maybe? not sure yet but now that inserting pictures is possible it might be fine
