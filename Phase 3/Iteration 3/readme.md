# Iteration 3: Addressing Quality Attribute Scenario Driver
This section presents the results of the activities that are performed in each of the steps of ADD in the third iteration of the design process. For this iteration the selected more important quality attributes, that being QA-1, QA-2, QA-3, and QA-5, drivers will be addressed.  

The [full pdf](https://github.com/JoeyVillafuerte/SOFE3650-Final-Project/blob/main/Phase%203/Iteration%203/Iteration%203.pdf) of iteration 2 will also be included.

### Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
For this iteration, the focus is on the QA-1, QA-2, QA-3, and QA-5 quality attributes, which are listed below in the scenario table:

We will be selecting QA-1 and QA-2 as they are the most critical quality attribute scenarios because without availability and security, the website will not be able to function properly and provide confidence in user protection.


### Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine
For this iteration we will want to refine the Application Server and Database Server as these are the two elements within the deployment plan that availability depends on and that we as architects can control.

### Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts that Satisfy the Selected Drivers
The design concepts used in this iteration are the following:

### Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces
The instantiation design decisions are summarized in the following table:

### Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions
The table below describes the new elements that were not derived in iteration 1.

### Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal and Achievement of Design Purpose
In this iteration, important design decisions have been made to address QA-1, QA-2, QA-3, and QA-5. The following table summarizes the status of the different drivers and the decisions that were made during the iteration:
